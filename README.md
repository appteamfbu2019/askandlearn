## Overview
### Description
An app focusing on connecting 'mentors' with certain skillsets and experiences to 'learners' with certain topics and areas they want to learn about but do not have the environment or means to. Mentors will be required to connect a LinkedIn profile for increased reliability and trustworthiness.

The "connections" will be formed in a similar way to the workings of the app Tinder, as both the mentors and the learners will have to 'match' with each other before communication can be established. This will help to minimize the proliferation of bots or spam/unwanted messages and will create more meaningful connections.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Education
- **Mobile:** Real-time, Convenient thumb-swipe interface
- **Story:** Allows users to give advice on areas of expertise, and simultaneously learn from experts in their field.
- **Market:** Anyone that wants to learn or wants to share.
- **Habit:** As with many easy-to-use, low-commitment apps that implement a swiping interface, swiping becomes easily addictive. Mentors and learners who have good reviews will receive 'points' that can make them feel validated. High point receivers can be invited to private events as a sort of 'elite club.' These incentives promote frequent and honest usage.
- **Scope:** The backend does not seem too complicated to implement, although we would need to implement a lot of tabs and features such as instant messaging that may be more difficult to tackle.
